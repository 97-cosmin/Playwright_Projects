# Playwright_Projects

Instructions to Run Tests
To run the automated tests for this project using Playwright, follow the steps below:.

#### **1. Install Node.js and NPM** ✅

Ensure you have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. You can check if they are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

     node -v
     npm -v
If they are not installed, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/.

**2. Clone the Repository** ✅
 First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
 
        git clone https://github.com/97-cosmin/Playwright_Projects.git
        cd Playwright_Projects

**3. Install Dependencies** ✅
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

        npm install

This will install all necessary packages, including Playwright.

**4. Run Tests in Headless Mode** ✅
By **default**, Playwright runs tests in **headless** mode, meaning the browser runs in the background without a visible UI.
This makes tests run faster and is useful for CI/CD pipelines.

To execute tests in headless mode, use:

       npx playwright test

If you want to run tests in headed mode (with a visible browser window for debugging), add the --headed flagL**(Optional)**

     npx playwright test --headed


**6. Run Specific Tests (Optional)** ✅
If you want to run specific tests or files, you can provide the test file path as an argument. For example:

        npx playwright test tests/filterMeetingsByCountry_Belgium.spec.ts

**7. Capture Screenshots on Test Failure** ✅

Playwright is configured to automatically capture screenshots whenever a test fails.
📍 Location in Code: playwright.config.ts → use: { screenshot: 'only-on-failure', screenshotPath: './screenshots', }

Captured screenshots are stored in the screenshots/ directory, making it easier to debug failed tests.
     
     use: {
       screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
       screenshotPath: './screenshots',
     },
**8. HTML Test Report Generation** ✅
Playwright automatically generates an HTML test report after running the tests. The report provides a detailed summary of test execution.
📍 Location in Code: playwright.config.ts → reporter: 'html'

        reporter: 'html',

**9. Cross-Browser Testing** ✅
The tests are configured to run on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility. The following browsers are included in the Playwright configuration (playwright.config.ts):
📍 Location in Code: playwright.config.ts → projects: [...]
     ✔ Chromium (Google Chrome)
     ✔ Firefox
     ✔ WebKit (Safari)
     ✔ Microsoft Edge

     projects: [
       {
         name: 'chromium',
         use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
       },
       {
         name: 'firefox',
         use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
       },
       {
         name: 'webkit',
         use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
       },
       {
         name: 'Microsoft Edge',
         use: { ...devices['Desktop Edge'], channel: 'msedge' },
       },
     ],

10. Using Playwright with TypeScript ✅
The project uses TypeScript for writing Playwright tests.

📍 Location in Code: The test files are stored in the tests/ folder and have a .ts extension.

11. Passing Configuration Settings as Environment Variables ✅
The project supports passing configuration settings like the Application URL via environment variables.

📍 Location in Code: Commented-out section in playwright.config.ts

12. Implementation of Page Object Model ✅
The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) to separate UI logic from test scripts.

📍 Location in Code: Page objects are stored in src/ directory. **https://github.com/97-cosmin/Playwright_Projects/blob/main/src/WDLandingPage.ts**
