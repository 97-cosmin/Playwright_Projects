Feedback for the automation exercise:

I faced difficulties when trying to access the "Update" button on the landing page. The issue was that the button didnâ€™t have a unique ID, and another button in the account name section shared the same ID. As a result, I had trouble selecting the correct button.

I tried several approaches using DevTools, but none worked. For example, I used the "Copy selector" option, but it didn't work due to the ID conflict. I also tried fdprocessedid and "Copy JS path," but these didn't work either.

In the end, I added an extra condition to differentiate the "Update" button based on its classes. The active button had a different class compared to the disabled one, which allowed me to correctly identify and select the button.

Suggestions for improvement:

To make automation easier in the future, it would help if the system:

Assigns unique IDs to important buttons for easier identification.

Avoids duplicating IDs on the page, ensuring each element can be uniquely targeted.
