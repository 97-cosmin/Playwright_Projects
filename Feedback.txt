Feedback for the Automation Exercise
TASK 1: Update Button Issue
Problem:

I faced difficulties when trying to access the "Update" button on the landing page.

The issue was caused by the button not having a unique ID.

Another button in the account name section shared the same ID, causing a conflict and making it difficult to select the correct button.

Approach:

I tried several approaches using DevTools to find the correct selector:

Tried the "Copy selector" option but it didn’t work due to the ID conflict.

Tried using fdprocessedid and "Copy JS path," but these also didn’t work.

Solution:

I added an extra condition to differentiate the "Update" button based on its classes:

The active button had a different class compared to the disabled one.

This allowed me to correctly identify and select the button.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Unique IDs: Assign unique IDs to important buttons for easier identification.

No Duplicate IDs: Avoid duplicating IDs on the page to ensure each element can be uniquely targeted.

TASK 2: No Data Found Message
Problem:

I had difficulty accessing the "No data found" message when there were no search results.

The selector for the message was found, but accessing it wasn’t straightforward due to the page’s dynamic structure and overlapping elements.

Approach:

I initially tried different methods using DevTools and selectors, but they didn’t work smoothly due to:

Inconsistent page loading.

Overlapping elements that complicated pinpointing the exact location of the message.

Solution:

I implemented a function that checks for the "No data found" message and ensures that the results list is empty.

This resolved the issue, and the test now correctly handles invalid search cases.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Consistent Selectors: The "No data found" message should have a more consistent or unique selector for easier access in automated tests.

Stable Page Structure: A more stable page structure could help reduce the complexity of finding elements like error messages or empty results.

Page Load Synchronization: Improving page load synchronization could help avoid delays and make automated tests more reliable.
